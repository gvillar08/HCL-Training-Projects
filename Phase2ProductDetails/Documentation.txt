Firstly, I set up my PetServlet, created the DBConnection for establishing a connection to the database, and created the other associated files. All cookie-cutter things for creating a functioning servlet. The coding really began in the PetServlet.doGet method. The try block runs the code if the connection can be made, otherwise, the two catch blocks handle connectivity issues. At the top and bottom of the block are html and body statements since all the code in between is essentially run as html. Then boilerplate lines are included for establishing a connection. From here, the user is shown the list of animals stored in the database and asked to search for one. Failed searches notify the user to enter a valid submission. Otherwise, all relevant matches are printed and print the name, color, and price. The searches are not case-sensitive. Although the sample SQL code included does not feature this, but if there are multiple animals named the same, it will print all of the values, not just the first one.
